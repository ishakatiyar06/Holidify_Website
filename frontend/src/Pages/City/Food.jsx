      The local cuisine include tabak maz, or flat pieces of meat cut from the ribs and fried till they acquire a crisp crackling texture, Gushtaba, which are meatballs moulded from pounded mutton like large-sized Rista (meat balls) but cooked in thick gravy of fresh curd base, Yakhni, a cream colored preparation of delicate flavor, is made with curd as a base, seekh kababs, Roganjosh, chaman- fried paneer (cottage cheese), in a thick sauce, dum-aloo - roasted potatoes in curd-based gravy.

There are various new flavours and innovative presentations of this ever popular sweet dish from Agra. Panchi petha is the most popular shop in Agra, and there are so many of these that you won't even have to think where to get it from.

      Another equally delicious item is the Chaat here. Agra has varieties of Chaat available including Aloo Tikki, Pani Puri, Papri Chaat, Samosa, Kachori etc all over the city. Another popular snack here is Dalmoth, which is a spicy lentil mix. The cuisine of the town also offers countless North-Indian and Punjabi relishes with a distinct influence of Mughlai cuisine.`,

The sea that is all around has a defining effect on the island's culture, livelihood and cuisine. There is little here, in which you will not find traces of the sea. The food here, hence, is dominated by seafood preparations and you don't want to miss the fish delicacies here. Other than seafood too, the staple diet is essentially non-vegetarian.
      However, as the island is becoming an increasingly popular tourist spot, the resorts and other eating places will give you options of Indian, Chinese and a few more cuisines.
      Also, the fruits here are popular and refreshing. You can find Mangoes, Bananas, Pineapples, Guava and more. One can also sip in the truly refreshing and tropical coconut water here.`,
